HELLO!!

The foloowing are the classes we use:
1: Cherry Drive
2: LimeLightTurretSystem
3: Indexer
4: Launcher
5: sparkFunMethodsClass
they are all under TeamCode/java/org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode. Everything else is for testing certain features or gradle stuff.
Unfortunately, the names we gave things in the code are all over the place and there isn't much of a standard we all follow. You
will find some names separated_by_underscores others withCapitalLettersLikeThis and some allsquishedtogetherinlowercase. On top of
that, some things like Indexer and sparkFunMethodsClass are analogous but are named differently. One might expect that they would be
named either indexerMethodsClass and SparkFunMethodsClass or Indexer and Sparkfun. The mixing of how things are named will
probably make it confusing, so make sure to watch out for that. If you ever get confused, one thing that may possibly help is holding
the 'command' or 'cntrl' key while clicking a method or class (this is an android studio thing and idk how much you know about android
studio. If you didn't already know this it is very helpful).

I don't know how much you know about ftc and how everything generally works so skip this paragraph if you know that already I guess.
'OpMode' is a kind of class that will directly control the robot. There are two built-in methods that are necesary for an OpMode:
'init' and 'loop' whose functions should be obvious. Above an Opmode will usually be the annotation @Tele-Op or @Autonomous.
@Tele-Op will be driver controlled and @Autonomous is (shockingly) autonomous. On the Driver Station (the phone looking thing) we
can set a robot configuration. The configuration will name all the ports with a string. so for example the controll hub motor port 0
is named "intake." Then we use the hardwaremap to assign a Motor object in the class to a specific port. That is what
"intake = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "intake");" and all the similar lines do.

Cherry Drive is the TeleOp we will use in the game. It has a bunch of methods that we use to organize the functions of each button input
it is the most important Class we have. LimelightTurretSystem, Indexer, Launcher, and sparkFunMethodsClass all have methods that control
their titular element. There will be comments(?) along each of the methods to describe wht they do. Each of them has an 'init()' that
is run in the init phase.

Our main question is how to keep all this organized in a nice way. Currently we are just guessing for most of it becuase none of us
have learned officially good practices for coding. Please look over the code and let us know if there are any patterns you can
easily notice where we could just be better. The current issues we have are with the launcher (the motors on top) not making it into
the goal every time even though we have the data tables in. Could the data tables be wrong or is our way of interpolating the values
the thing that gives us problems?
